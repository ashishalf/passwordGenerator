## Code Explanation

### Components

- **App Component**: The main component that includes the logic for password generation and UI elements.

### Hooks

- `useState`: Manages the state of password length, inclusion of numbers and special characters, and the generated password.
- `useCallback`: Memoizes the password generation and copy-to-clipboard functions.
- `useEffect`: Automatically generates a new password whenever the length or inclusion options change.
- `useRef`: References the password input field to facilitate copying to the clipboard.

### Password Generation Logic

The `passwordGenerator` function generates a random password based on the selected options and updates the state with the new password. The `copyPasswordToClipboard` function allows the generated password to be copied to the clipboard.
